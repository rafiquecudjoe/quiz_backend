          "sample_answer": "This question requires the original set of scores from previous parts. Assuming an original dataset of 8 scores (e.g., 30, 35, 40, 42, 45, 48, 50, 52) with an original median of 43.5, adding x=1 student with a score of 43 results in the dataset: 30, 35, 40, 42, 43, 45, 48, 50, 52 (N=9). The new median (5th value) is 43. Thus, the minimum value of x is 1.",
          "explanation": "The minimum value of x is the smallest number of additional students needed to shift the median to 43. This requires knowing the original scores and their distribution. If the original median was slightly higher than 43 (e.g., 43.5), adding one score of 43 in the correct position can make 43 the new median.",
          "step_by_step_answer": "Step 1: Understand the definition of a median. The median is the middle value of an ordered dataset. If the number of data points is odd, it's the single middle value. If even, it's the average of the two middle values.\n(Note: This step requires the original set of scores from a previous part of the question. Let's assume for demonstration an original dataset of 8 scores: 30, 35, 40, 42, 45, 48, 50, 52. The original median is (42+45)/2 = 43.5.)\n\nStep 2: Determine how adding 'x' students with new scores can make the median 43. To achieve a new median of 43 with the minimum 'x', the new scores should ideally be 43 (or slightly below/above if necessary to form an average of 43).\n\nStep 3: Test the minimum possible value for 'x', which is 1. If we add x=1 student whose score is 43, the new dataset (ordered) would be: 30, 35, 40, 42, 43, 45, 48, 50, 52. The new total number of students is 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nStep 4: Find the median of the new dataset. For 9 data points, the median is the (9+1)/2 = 5th value. In the new ordered list, the 5th value is 43.\nSince adding x=1 student with a score of 43 achieves a median of 43, this is the minimum value of x.\n\n**Final Answer:** 1",

            "Consider the effect of adding one student with a score of 43 on the existing median.",
            "The 'minimum value of x' implies trying small integer values for x, starting from 1."
